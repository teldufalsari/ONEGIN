The light in the dust lies dead;
Where never mortal pinnace glided,
The boat of my desire is guided:
The rainbow's glory is shed;
When hearts have once mingled,
The weak one is singled
Asia: From Prometheus Unbound
Till, like one in slumber bound,
Borne to the ocean, I float down, around,
Into a sea profound, of ever-spreading sound:
When the cloud is scatter'd,
WHEN the lamp is shatter'd,
And rest, having beheld; somewhat like thee;
Bright reason will mock thee,
Its passions will rock thee,
Beyond the glassy gulfs we flee
Peopled by shapes too bright to see,
When leaves fall and cold winds come.
Will rot, and thine eagle home
The frailty of all things here,
Survive not the lamp and the lute,
No song when the spirit is mute--
Harmonizing this earth with what we feel above.
Realms where the air we breathe is love,
Which in the winds and on the waves doth move,
Whilst all the winds with melody are ringing.
Upon the silver waves of thy sweet singing;
As the storms rock the ravens on high:
Like the wind through a ruin'd cell,
That ring the dead seaman's knell.
Wildernesses calm and green,
And watery paths that wind between
When the lips have spoken,
When the lute is broken,
Catching the winds that fan that happy heaven.
But, by the instinct of sweet music driven;
And we sail on, away, afar,
Without a course, without a star,
The heart's echoes render
For your cradle, your home, and your bier?
From thy nest every rafter
Leave thee naked to laughter,
It seems to float ever, for ever,
Upon that many-winding river,
As music and splendour
No song but sad dirges,
Or the mournful surges
Lines
A paradise of wildernesses!
Between mountains, woods, abysses,
We have past Age's icy caves,
And Manhood's dark and tossing waves,
In music's most serene dominions;
Meanwhile thy spirit lifts its pinions
A paradise of vaulted bowers,
Lit by downward-gazing flowers,
Till through Elysian garden islets
By thee, most beautiful of pilots,
My soul is an enchanted boat,
Which, like a sleeping swan, doth float
Beside a helm conducting it,
And thine doth like an angel sit
Loved accents are soon forgot.
Sweet tones are remember'd not
Why choose you the frailest
O Love, who bewailest
Love first leaves the well-built nest;
To endure what it once possest.
Through Death and Birth, to a diviner day;
And Youth's smooth ocean, smiling to betray:
Of shadow-peopled Infancy,
Like the sun from a wintry sky.
Which walk upon the sea, and chant melodiously!

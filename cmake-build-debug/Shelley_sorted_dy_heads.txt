A paradise of vaulted bowers,
A paradise of wildernesses!
And Manhood's dark and tossing waves,
And Youth's smooth ocean, smiling to betray:
And rest, having beheld; somewhat like thee;
And thine doth like an angel sit
And watery paths that wind between
And we sail on, away, afar,
As music and splendour
As the storms rock the ravens on high:
Asia: From Prometheus Unbound
Beside a helm conducting it,
Between mountains, woods, abysses,
Beyond the glassy gulfs we flee
Borne to the ocean, I float down, around,
Bright reason will mock thee,
But, by the instinct of sweet music driven;
By thee, most beautiful of pilots,
Catching the winds that fan that happy heaven.
For your cradle, your home, and your bier?
From thy nest every rafter
Harmonizing this earth with what we feel above.
In music's most serene dominions;
Into a sea profound, of ever-spreading sound:
It seems to float ever, for ever,
Its passions will rock thee,
Leave thee naked to laughter,
Like the sun from a wintry sky.
Like the wind through a ruin'd cell,
Lines
Lit by downward-gazing flowers,
Love first leaves the well-built nest;
Loved accents are soon forgot.
Meanwhile thy spirit lifts its pinions
My soul is an enchanted boat,
No song but sad dirges,
No song when the spirit is mute--
O Love, who bewailest
Of shadow-peopled Infancy,
Or the mournful surges
Peopled by shapes too bright to see,
Realms where the air we breathe is love,
Survive not the lamp and the lute,
Sweet tones are remember'd not
That ring the dead seaman's knell.
The boat of my desire is guided:
The frailty of all things here,
The heart's echoes render
The light in the dust lies dead;
The rainbow's glory is shed;
The weak one is singled
Through Death and Birth, to a diviner day;
Till through Elysian garden islets
Till, like one in slumber bound,
To endure what it once possest.
Upon that many-winding river,
Upon the silver waves of thy sweet singing;
WHEN the lamp is shatter'd,
We have past Age's icy caves,
When hearts have once mingled,
When leaves fall and cold winds come.
When the cloud is scatter'd,
When the lips have spoken,
When the lute is broken,
Where never mortal pinnace glided,
Which in the winds and on the waves doth move,
Which walk upon the sea, and chant melodiously!
Which, like a sleeping swan, doth float
Whilst all the winds with melody are ringing.
Why choose you the frailest
Wildernesses calm and green,
Will rot, and thine eagle home
Without a course, without a star,
